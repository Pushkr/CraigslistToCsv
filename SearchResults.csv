2015 V-STAR 1300 TOURER!!! JUST PURCHASED YAMAHA FACTORY SALE!!! LAST ONE!!

ORIGINAL RETAIL WAS $12,765

OUR PRICE IS $10,390

$2,375 SAVINGS OFF OF ORIGINAL PRICE!!!

INCLUDES A FULL-FACTORY WARRANTY!!!!

The V Star 1300 Tourer comes standard with hard leather-wrapped sidebags, passenger backrest and windshield. The touring package is designed from the factory so it's styled consistently with the bike's fluid lines.

The midsize V Star 1300 Tourer brings modern-classic styling along for a lighter, sportier, hot-rod-inspired ride.

80-cubic-inch (1304cc) liquid-cooled, fuel-injected V-twin produces excellent power across the board along with a highly stimulating exhaust note.

Modern-classic design, including a two-into-one exhaust, gives the V Star 1300 Tourer that distinctive StarÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â® look.

Steel chassis gets 48 percent of the bike's weight on the front tire, for quick, light handling and maneuverability.

Authentic cruiser features such as belt drive, steel fenders and fuel tank, open up the customization possibilities even further.

Estimated 42 mpg* means over 200 miles of riding between fill-ups.
The Star Accessories Catalog is packed full of high-quality parts that invite Star owners to fully express their individuality.

A 3D tank emblem design adorns the V Star 1300 Tourer and evokes a modern-classic look.

The V Star 1300 Tourer gets lots of chrome with a chrome headlight housing and chrome belt guard. Plus, there's a gloss black finish on the frame that adds a high-quality look.

Star quality paint, chrome and detailing vie for attention wherever you look; fenders are steel not plastic.

Retro-modern bar-mounted instrumentation contains analog speedometer along with LCD display; indicator lights for high beam, turn signal, low oil level, low fuel, coolant temperature, neutral--and engine diagnostic function.

Floating floorboards and an adjustable heel/toe shifter provide a comfortable, low-effort ride and makes moving through the 5-speed gearbox a snap.

02 sensor and catalyst reduce emissions.

2001 Honda Civic for sale. Approximately 185,000 miles on odometer. 5 speed manual 

The good:
Runs and starts well, was being driven an hour one way to work five times a week up until this week when new car purchased. No check engine lights!
Lots of recent maintenance :
-Spark plugs and coil packs changed this spring
-Manual transmission fluid changed at Saratoga Honda summer 2015
-Rear drums replaced June 2016
-Brand new general altimax tires mounted and balanced June 2016 (approximately 5,000 miles on them)
-Timing belt was done approximately 2011 at ~110k miles

The bad:
-Rust on passenger side door and above rear passenger wheel. 
-ghetto spoiler delete (removed because it was rusting/falling off)
-Hood pins (hood latch broke - removed and installed sparco hood pins which work great)
-Interior - passenger side door panel very loose, upholstery pulling away on inside roof and door panels. 
-Burning about 1.5 quarts of oil every 5 thousand miles
-Recently started consuming coolant (about 1 quart per week). Not leaking from anywhere so I'm assuming it's finding its way into the engine, which would probably indicate the engine needs a new head gasket 

Text 51Eight-3Three8-5Nine98. Asking $1250, make me an offer.

2015 V-STAR 950!!! JUST PURCHASED YAMAHA FACTORY SALE!!! LAST ONES!!

ONE AVAILABLE IN REDDISH COPPER!!

AND ONE AVAILABLE IN RAVEN BLACK!!

ORIGINAL RETAIL WAS $9,065

OUR PRICE IS $6,999 ON EACH!!

$2,065 SAVINGS OFF OF ORIGINAL PRICE!!!

INCLUDES A FULL-FACTORY WARRANTY!!!!

V Star 950 is the benchmark in the entry cruiser class, appealing to seasoned riders as well as those looking for a friendly entry-level cruiser. The air-cooled V-twin delivers plenty of distinctive, big-cruiser character and pulsing torque feel. Seat height is an extra-low 26.6 inches. The full-sized chassis has a long, low look and provides spacious comfort. Handling is sporty and responsive, great for curvy back roads and commuting around town as well as open-highway cruising.

The 942cc 60ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â° V-twin engine is both simple and sophisticated. Sure, there's no-fuss air cooling for traditional looks. But inside you'll find the reason for the surprisingly spirited performance: four-valve cylinder heads, ceramic-composite-lined cylinders, forged aluminum pistons, and fuel injection. The meticulously tuned 2-into-1 exhaust system has a throaty exhaust note, and also 3-way catalyst technology to reduce air pollution.

The carefully designed chassis contributes to an exceptionally light feeling riders are sure to appreciate. The double-cradle steel main frame offers an ideal rigidity balance in the longitudinal, lateral, and torsional directions, using the engine as a stressed member. With the engine mounting position slightly forward for optimum front-rear weight distribution and its large, 18-inch front wheel, V Star 950 has outstanding handling performance.

The V Star 950 achieves fuel economy up to an estimated 47 mpg* with a fuel tank that holds 4.5 gallons of gas.

Fenders are real steel, front and rear. That adds to the quality look and feel, and makes customization easier.

The 58 cubic inch (942cc) engine is an air-cooled SOHC 60ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â° V twin. With four valves per cylinder, a pent-roof shaped combustion chamber, and 9.0:1 compression ratio, this engine has been carefully designed to produce excellent power characteristics, and best-in-class acceleration.

To keep friction loss to a minimum and help the engine achieve the ideal performance characteristics, special compact roller-type rocker arms with needle bearings are used. These also reduce top-end weight for excellent mass centralization.

The combustion chamber shape was precisely engineered to direct the fuel air charge into the center of the piston for faster combustion and maximum power. Ceramic-composite-plated cylinders provide excellent heat dissipation and reduced oil consumption.

High-quality forged aluminum pistons have a lightweight, high-strength compact design that contributes to reduce vibration.

Sophisticated fuel injection is used on the V Star 950. The injectors are four-hole, two-directional types with spray aimed at the valve surfaces. That produces good fuel atomization for faster and more complete combustion which contributes to excellent drivability. The fuel injection system also adopts an ISC (Idling Speed Control) valve for outstanding idling stability.

Lubrication is provided by a simple, reliable wet sump system.

The 5-speed transmission has a smooth shifting feeling, and gear ratios spaced to let the rider take full advantage of the engine's torque characteristics and enjoy comfortable cruising at highway speeds. 

Naturally, power is efficiently transferred to the rear wheel using a simple, quiet belt drive.
The engine's look is highly detailed, with polished cylinder fins and beautifully chrome-plated cylinder head covers, for an exceptional appearance sure to be noticed.

2015 V-STAR 950!!! JUST PURCHASED YAMAHA FACTORY SALE!!! LAST ONES!!

ONE AVAILABLE IN REDDISH COPPER!!

AND ONE AVAILABLE IN RAVEN BLACK!!

ORIGINAL RETAIL WAS $9,065

OUR PRICE IS $6,999 ON EACH!!

$2,065 SAVINGS OFF OF ORIGINAL PRICE!!!

INCLUDES A FULL-FACTORY WARRANTY!!!!

V Star 950 is the benchmark in the entry cruiser class, appealing to seasoned riders as well as those looking for a friendly entry-level cruiser. The air-cooled V-twin delivers plenty of distinctive, big-cruiser character and pulsing torque feel. Seat height is an extra-low 26.6 inches. The full-sized chassis has a long, low look and provides spacious comfort. Handling is sporty and responsive, great for curvy back roads and commuting around town as well as open-highway cruising.

The 942cc 60ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â° V-twin engine is both simple and sophisticated. Sure, there's no-fuss air cooling for traditional looks. But inside you'll find the reason for the surprisingly spirited performance: four-valve cylinder heads, ceramic-composite-lined cylinders, forged aluminum pistons, and fuel injection. The meticulously tuned 2-into-1 exhaust system has a throaty exhaust note, and also 3-way catalyst technology to reduce air pollution.

The carefully designed chassis contributes to an exceptionally light feeling riders are sure to appreciate. The double-cradle steel main frame offers an ideal rigidity balance in the longitudinal, lateral, and torsional directions, using the engine as a stressed member. With the engine mounting position slightly forward for optimum front-rear weight distribution and its large, 18-inch front wheel, V Star 950 has outstanding handling performance.

The V Star 950 achieves fuel economy up to an estimated 47 mpg* with a fuel tank that holds 4.5 gallons of gas.

Fenders are real steel, front and rear. That adds to the quality look and feel, and makes customization easier.

The 58 cubic inch (942cc) engine is an air-cooled SOHC 60ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â° V twin. With four valves per cylinder, a pent-roof shaped combustion chamber, and 9.0:1 compression ratio, this engine has been carefully designed to produce excellent power characteristics, and best-in-class acceleration.

To keep friction loss to a minimum and help the engine achieve the ideal performance characteristics, special compact roller-type rocker arms with needle bearings are used. These also reduce top-end weight for excellent mass centralization.

The combustion chamber shape was precisely engineered to direct the fuel air charge into the center of the piston for faster combustion and maximum power. Ceramic-composite-plated cylinders provide excellent heat dissipation and reduced oil consumption.

High-quality forged aluminum pistons have a lightweight, high-strength compact design that contributes to reduce vibration.

Sophisticated fuel injection is used on the V Star 950. The injectors are four-hole, two-directional types with spray aimed at the valve surfaces. That produces good fuel atomization for faster and more complete combustion which contributes to excellent drivability. The fuel injection system also adopts an ISC (Idling Speed Control) valve for outstanding idling stability.

Lubrication is provided by a simple, reliable wet sump system.

The 5-speed transmission has a smooth shifting feeling, and gear ratios spaced to let the rider take full advantage of the engine's torque characteristics and enjoy comfortable cruising at highway speeds. 

Naturally, power is efficiently transferred to the rear wheel using a simple, quiet belt drive.
The engine's look is highly detailed, with polished cylinder fins and beautifully chrome-plated cylinder head covers, for an exceptional appearance sure to be noticed.

Up for sale is my girlfriends 2015 Honda CB300F. She bought it brand new just a few months ago and has only put 66 miles on it. Unfortunately she just doesn't have the time to ride it. She owes just over $4500 on it still. Which we will acquire a lien release same day as potential sale (if the bank is open). We would like to get as close to $4500 or best offer in order to pay off what she owes on it. Not looking to trade anything, any cash offer will be considered.  
The bike is lowered on a fully adjustable lowering link and has a fully adjustable side stand making it perfect for a shorter rider. Also has frame sliders on it and shorty levers. EXCELLENT beginners bike to learn on or for a commuter bike seeing as it gets amazing mpg. It was dropped once while not moving causing very minimal damage on the right hand side of the bike, which can be seen in pictures.

DescriptionJust Arrived!!!  Righteous Look. Right Price.      You don’t kick back and relax in a suit and tie. When you want to take it easy  you slip into something more comfortable  a little more your style. Same with a motorcycle. And time is the test of style. So when you want to go for a nice  relaxed ride  you want a bike that fits you like your favorite leather jacket or your old blue jeans  and one that looks just as chill too. And that’s what the Honda Shadow Aero is all about. Our Shadow line of cruisers are some of the most popular bikes on the road  and one look at the Shadow Aero will tell you why. Features like its spoked wheels  full fenders and long  chromed mufflers are all about taking it easy  and looking good while you’re doing it. But the Aero rider also gets some thoroughly modern performance courtesy of this bike’s 745 cc V-twin engine  specially tuned for low-revving torque. Maintenance-reducing features like shaft final drive make the Aero easy to own. And best of all  the Aero is a huge bargain  giving you a big-bike ride without the big-bike price.

This midsize StarÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â® brings modern classic styling along for a lighter, sportier, hot-rod-inspired ride.

80-cubic-inch (1304cc) liquid-cooled, fuel-injected V-twin produces excellent power across the board along with a highly stimulating exhaust note.

Modern-classic design, including a two-into-one exhaust, gives the V Star 1300 that distinctive Star look.

Steel chassis gets 48 percent of the bike's weight on the front tire, for quick, light handling and maneuverability.

Authentic cruiser features such as belt drive and steel fenders open up the customization possibilities even further.

Estimated 42 mpg* means over 200 miles of riding between fill-ups.
The Star Accessories Catalog is packed full of high-quality parts that invite Star owners to fully express their individuality.

Star quality paint, chrome and detailing vie for attention wherever you look; fenders are steel not plastic.

A 3D tank emblem design adorns the V Star 1300 and evokes a modern-classic look.

The V Star 1300 gets lot of chrome with a chrome headlight housing and chrome belt guard. Plus, there's a gloss black finish on the frame that adds a high-quality look.

Retro-modern bar-mounted instrumentation contains analog speedometer along with LCD display; indicator lights for high beam, turn signal, low oil level, low fuel, coolant temperature, neutral--and engine diagnostic function.

Rider floorboards for comfort and room; heel/toe shifter makes moving through the five-speed gearbox a snap.

Bright multireflector headlight, LED taillight and amber turn signals behind clear lenses give a custom look.

02 sensor and catalyst reduce emissions.

TRUCK CAMPER,http://albany.craigslist.org/rvs/5725557789.html,$38000," (WEST SPRINGFIELD, MA)",2016-08-10,11:27:32,2016-08-15,08:35:00,"
Well sometimes life throws you curve balls and one has just gotten thrown at the wife and me. Because of an unexpected and unanticipated family crisis we must sell our unused 2016 Arctic Fox 1140 truck camper. We cannot in good conscience take off for weeks or months at a time with the family situation as it stands now. Our plans of crisscrossing the Canadian provinces, hitting the Alcan Highway to Alaska and exploring Alaska, then coming back and going in search of America have now been put on hold for the foreseeable future. 

We bought this camper on June 24th 2016 from Truck Camper Warehouse in West Chesterfield, NH. We stayed in it one night at the warehouse, on one of their campsites, as they like you to do to familiarize yourself with the camper and how everything works. Next day we drove it home to West Springfield, a 60 mile trip, and dropped it on the cement slab we had put in this spring so we would have a dedicated place to put the camper. We spent the next week or so shopping to get all the accouterments to outfit the camper for short and long hauls. I am talking everything like toasters, coffeepots, camp chairs, silverware, plates, sheets, pillows and on and on. This baby was loaded and ready to go.

The day before we were supposed to take it on its first break-in/learn trip up to Lake Ontario, the turd hit the turbines, (as we say in the Air Force) with the family situation. There is a sizable sum of money tied up in the camper and the 2016 Chevy Silverado Duramax Crew Cab dually diesel with 8' bed. Because there is no change anticipated with the family situation for at least the next few years we feel it best that we try and sell it rather than have it just sitting on the cement slab for a few years therefore we are trying to sell the camper, at a little loss.

It is a beautiful camper with the slide out for the dinette and cooking area. Plenty roomy and well-built with dark cherry cabinets and an aluminum framed super structure to prevent rot.

It has all the standard feature as shown in the link to the web site and on the attached picture. It has the FOX VALUE PACKAGE shown in the same. For additional options it has:

EZ open handle
AM/FM/CD/DVDPLAYER
22"" 110/12V LED TV
Thermal pane windows
Fox Landing (these are the nice step that fold out at an angle so you are not stepping on your trailer hitch when exiting the camper.
It has a wet bath
11K BTU Air Conditioner
3 burner cook top
Microwave oven
Slide-out topper
Rear motorized awning

We also equipped it with dealer installed:

2 Trojan AGM G27 batteries
Back up camera.
Additional aluminum step
Honda 2000i generator
Aluminum Torque Lift Tiedowns with Fast Gun restraints.
Hitch extension with wiring so we could also pull our boat.

This is about as well equipped truck camper as you will find. You will need to do nothing but change out the tie-downs for your truck, load her up and drive her away. Existing tie downs are for a 2016 Chevy 3500 dually. This camper fully loaded will require a truck with an 8' bed GVW of around 13,000-14,000 pounds. I was told you can get away with a single rear wheel vehicle with the addition of Stabil loads and suspension air bags but I would not suggest it. It's in better shape now than when we bought with the wax job that took three days to finish.

Total we paid for this camper which has only seen a 60 mile ride home was $40,000. We have probably added $500 dollars' worth of stuff equipping it. I am asking $38,000.
I can only find the NADA value for a 2015 1140 Arctic Fox equipped similar to ours (ours has a few more options).  Link below.

This is the link to the Northwood Mfg. site for the Arctic Fox 1140 truck camper.

http://northwoodmfg.com/truck-campers/arctic-fox-camper/af-camper-1140/

The camper is located in West Springfield, Massachusetts.

I might consider selling the tuck and camper as a whole package. I don't need this big a truck as I will not have the camper. I am having a little trouble getting a used truck value on it because it is a 2016 but if someone is interested we can talk.

2016 Chevrolet Silverado 3500HD Crew Cab, 8'bed, Duramax Diesel, dual rear wheels, 14000lb GVW, 4,700lb payload package. It has just about every option available except the rear seat DVD player. It has less than 7,000 miles on it. On the recent trip to Florida it got 22MPG highway unloaded. Average mileage overall all is 16 MPG. That isn't bad for a big truck like this. Again I am just considering selling the truck because I like it so darn much.    "

Honda CD 175 Sloper.  Honda Touring 175.  Currently registered and on the road.  I had it inspected last year, this year I have not made it down to get the inspection done.  All the lights work as they should as well as the electric starter.  The horn is hit and miss.  Also included is a set of new rims.  The current ones are not bent, just a little rusty.  Bike had a professional tune up in March of 2015.  The engine runs great, sounds lovely.  The exterior shows signs of 48 years.  Some touch up paint here and there, a little rust, (NONE in the tank). The seat has a new cover and I also have the chrome edging and seat strap but they are not installed.  Overall a very nice vintage bike.  Google the Honda Sloper 175 for more info on this interesting Honda.  Calls preferred to 518-858-65zero1.  Thanks for looking.    "

Runs perfect, clean title, haven't had a single issue with it. I am the second owner, took it over around 70K, is at 126K now. Proper routine maintenance done myself since. Moving into a new season of life where a small car makes more sense for me. Honda VTEC 4 cyl with timing chain, low maintenance for sure. 

This thing just hauled everything I own and towed a motorcycle 1500 miles from Minneapolis, MN to the Adirondacks with absolutely no issues. She is a champ.

2008 Honda Element EX
129000 miles
All Wheel Drive
5 Speed Manual transmission
Fuel Economy: 21 city/25 highway
Towing package, Honda OEM class I hitch with wiring harness
Clean interior
Custom GOBI roof rack, fairing, rear ladder, with internal wiring for lights. Bought new for $1600. Good luck finding these anywhere but from GOBI. 600lb+ load capability, super functional.
Got in a fender bender in October 2015, insurance covered almost a complete new front end. Looks flawless (fresh paint, new radiator, AC/water pump, and many other small items) and works like new. Notice the small dent in the driver's side door; Murphy's Law. One week after the repairs a deer ran into me from the side of the road. Wasn't into dropping another deductible to fix it since it's cosmetic. Already took a few hundred off the asking price for that.
Black plasti dipped OEM wheels, badges, and some trim
40K on the all-weather tires, still plenty of life left

Recent updates:
New rear pads and rotors on 5/1
New rear sway bar links on 5/1
New spark plugs on 5/1
Fluids topped on 5/1

Asking $10,000

Not interested in trades, no tire kickers, price is firm. Text or email please!

This bike is like new with a little over 500 miles on it. All stock parts are included. No major modifications, minor bolt-on aesthetics. To purchase this bike new and add all the mods it would be over 3k. Going to school and need to sell. Would consider trades for the right 5 speed car.

Speedo mounted in battery box
Shaved bunny ears and repainted headlight bracket

This bike has no lien, ready to go. Not a single issue with the bike, just had its first oil change. The bike has a 12 month transferable warranty as of April of this year when the bike was purchased new. It's a fun little runabout, just can't take it with me.    "

So when you want to go for a nice  relaxed ride  you want a bike that fits you like your favorite leather jacket or your old blue jeans  and one that looks just as chill too. And that’s what the Honda Shadow Aero is all about. Our Shadow line of cruisers are some of the most popular bikes on the road  and one look at the Shadow Aero will tell you why. Features like its spoked wheels  full fenders and long  chromed mufflers are all about taking it easy  and looking good while you’re doing it. But the Aero rider also gets some thoroughly modern performance courtesy of this bike’s 745 cc V-twin engine  specially tuned for low-revving torque. Maintenance-reducing features like shaft final drive make the Aero easy to own. And best of all  the Aero is a huge bargain  giving you a big-bike ride without the big-bike price.

Hi I'm selling my 2011 cbr 1000rr I am the second owner of the bike. Has low miles never abused and always stored inside. The previous owner custom painted the hole bike and helmet to match. Bike is in amazing condition routine maintenance. Sence I purchased the bike in April of 2015 I have put about 3/4 of a mile on the bike I don't have time to ride and cost me to much to insure. Bike will come with extras and a brand new cover. Bike is worth every penny I'm asking and I will not drop 10,000 cash in hand. Not to sound like an ass but if someone can ask $8000 for a beat 06 Honda with high miles $10,000 should be no problem for this bike. I have all the paper work in my hand including owners manual. If you would like text me I will send pics bike is spotless.    "
